    <h2>This flavourful pasta dish is a perfect example that sometimes simple is best</h2>
    <p>It’s creamy, zingy and fresh, and a death row meal for me.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300g packet silken tofu</li>
        <li>3 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>2 tsp white miso</li>
        <li>¾ tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Juice and grated zest of 2 lemons</li>
        <li>8 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Fine sea salt</li>
        <li>300g spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>50g rocket leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the silken tofu, nutritional yeast, miso, black pepper, lemon juice, six tablespoons of the oil and a teaspoon and a half of salt in a blender and blitz smooth.</li>
        <li>Bring two litres of water to a boil, add two teaspoons of salt and cook the spaghetti according to the packet instructions. Near the end of the cooking time, scoop out a mugful of the starchy cooking water, then drain the pasta and drizzle with a little oil.</li>
        <li>Put the remaining two tablespoons of oil in a wide frying pan on a medium heat and, when it’s hot, stir in the garlic and cook for a couple of minutes, just to the point when it’s sticky and golden and smells of garlic bread. Tip the tofu mix into the pan, stir to combine, then add the pasta and lemon zest, and mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the reserved pasta water tablespoon by tablespoon to create a looser sauce, if need be (this may not be necessary), mix again, then take off the heat. Fold through the rocket and serve.</li>
    </ol>
