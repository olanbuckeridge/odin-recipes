    <h2>Chopped salad offers a festival of textures and flavours all in the one mouthful</h2>    
    <p>There is great pleasure to be had in both chopping ingredients to sling with abandon into a bowl, and in munching on a festival of textures and flavours all in the one mouthful.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g quinoa</li>
        <li>Fine sea salt</li>
        <li>300g Tenderstem</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>400g tin chickpeas</li>
        <li>5cm x 2cm piece fresh root ginger</li>
        <li>4 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp white miso paste</li>
        <li>70g roasted whole almonds</li>
        <li>150g frozen petit pois</li>
        <li>250g red cabbage</li>
        <li>1 baby gem lettuce</li>
        <li>30g parsley</li>
        <li>Hummus</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the quinoa in a medium saucepan for which you have a lid, add 400ml cold water and a half-teaspoon of salt, cover the pan and turn on the heat to high. Bring to a boil, turn down the heat to low and simmer for 12 minutes. Take off the heat and put to one side, still covered.</li>
        <li>While the quinoa is cooking, put a large, wide pan for which you have a lid on a medium heat and, when hot, add the broccoli and three tablespoons of water, pop on the lid, leave to cook for three or four minutes, until tender, then drain.</li>
        <li>Put two tablespoons of oil in the same pan on a high heat, until hot, then add the chickpeas so they sit in a single layer and leave to cook for five minutes. Shake well, cook for another five minutes, then take off the heat and sprinkle over an eighth of a teaspoon of salt.</li>
        <li>To make the dressing, put the ginger, rice vinegar, miso, half a teaspoon of salt and 120ml extra-virgin olive oil in a bowl and whisk well.</li>        
    </ol>
